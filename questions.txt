4. the formula for a line is normally given as y = mx +b. write  a method Line() that expects three
    float formal parameters, a slop m, a y-intercept b, and an x-coordinate x. the
    method computes the y-coordinate associated with the line specified by m and b at 
    x-coordinate.

5. write a method intersect() with four float parameters m1,b1,m2,b2. the parameters come conceptually in two pairs. 
the first pair contains the coefficients describing one line; the second pair contains coefficients describing a second line.
 the method returns 1 if the two lines intersect. otherwise, it should return 0;

 you should use a recursive method called factorial() to calculate the factorial of the number.


 7. write another program that accepts a number form the user and returns the Fibonacci value of that number.
 you should use recursion in here.

17. an ISBN (international standard book number ) consists of 10 digits
d1d2d3d4d5d6d7d8d9d10. the last digit is a checksum , which is calculated form the other nine digit
using the following formula.
(d1*1 +d2*2 +d3*3 +d4*4 + d5*5 +d6*6+d7*7 +d8*8 + d9*9)%11
if the checksum is 10 , the last digit is denoted X according to the ISBN convention.
write a program that prompts the user to enter the first 9 digits and displays the 10-digits ISBN
(including leading zeros). your program should read the input as an integer.
for example if you enter 013601267, the program should display 0136012671.


18. write an application that computes the value of e^x by using the formula.

    e^x = 1+ x/1! + x^2/2!  + x^3/3! +...


19. write a program that displays all the leap year , ten per line, in the twenty-first century
(from 2001 to 2100).

20. write a program that reads integers, finds the largest of them, and counts its occurrences.
assume that the input ends with number 0. suppose that you entered 3 5 2 5 5 5 0; the program finds that
the largest is 5 and the occurrence count for 5 is 4.

(hint: maintain two variables, max and count. max stores the current max number,and
count stores its occurrences. initially , assign the first number to max and 1 to count.
compare each subsequent number with max. if the number is greater than max , assign it to
max and reset count to 1. if the number is equal to max, increment count by 1.)

e.g enter numbers: 3 5 2 5 5 5 0
the largest number is 5.
the occurrence count of the largest number is 4.


21. write a program that displays all integers between low and high that are the sum of the coube
of their digits, in other words, find all numbers xyz such that xyz= x^3 +y^3 +z^3, for 
example, 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 +3^3, try 100 for low and 1000 for high.


22. write a program that returns the number of digits in an integer argument; for example
23,498 has five digits. the program repeatedly asks for input and displays the number of digits 
the input integer has. stop the repetition when the input value is negative.

23. there are 25 primes between 2 and 100, and there are1229 primes between 2 and 10000.
write a program that inputs a positive integer N>2 and displays the number of primes between 2 and N(inclusive).

24. a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors.
a proper divisor is a positive integer other than the number itself that divides the number evenly(i.e no remainder).
for example, 6 is a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors 1,2,and 3 is equal to 6. the next is 28 =14 +7+4+2+1.
there are four perfect numbers less than 10000.eight is not a perfect number because 1 +2+4+8. write a program that accepts a positive integer and determines whether the number is perfect. also display all proper divisors of the number.


25. write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers, determines how many positive and negative values have been read, and computes the total and average of the input
value (not counting zeros). your program ends with the input 0. display the average as a floating-point number.here is a sample run:

enter an int value, the program exits if the input is 0:
the number of positives is 3
the number of negatives is 1
the total is 5
the average is 1.25

26. suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year.

worth of tuition starting ten years from now.

  1 2 3
    1 2
      1

33. write a program that prompts the user to enter an integer from 1 to 15 and displays a
pyramid, as shown in the following sample run:

enter the number of lines: 4
     1
   2 1 2
 3 2 1 2 3
4 3 2 1 2 3 4

36. write a program that prompts the user to enter a decimal integer and display its corresponding hexadecimal value.
